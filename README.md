# The Asylum in the Woods

## Description

"The Asylum in the Woods" is a text-based psychological horror adventure game written in Python. This game was created as part of the Codedex course checkpoint for The Legend of Python, chapters 1-4. Players take on the role of Javier, a psychology student starting an internship at a remote psychiatric hospital. As the story unfolds, players must navigate through increasingly disturbing events and make choices that will determine their fate.

## Codedex Course Context

This game was developed as a response to the following checkpoint in the Codedex Python course:

The checkpoint required creating a terminal-based adventure game (terminal_game.py) that presents the player with 2 or more options at each step of the adventure. This game fulfills that requirement while exploring a psychological horror theme.

## Features

- Immersive storytelling with rich, descriptive text
